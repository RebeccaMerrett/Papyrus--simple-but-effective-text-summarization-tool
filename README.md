# Papyrus--simple-but-effective-text-summarization-tool

This is a demonstration of summary extraction tool Papyrus, which is used on a large corpus taken from a government transcript.
This was built during a 46-hour hackathon ([GovHack](https://govhack.org/)), so it's a quick solution, but effective in what we need it to do.

We were utilising NLTK, but needed more time to achieve good results. 
Online tools like Resoomer, for example, seemed to miss a lot of context with Australian government transcripts. 

This is part of the original GovHack project repo is here: [https://github.com/JesseChavez/papyrus](https://github.com/JesseChavez/papyrus) (open source MPL 2.0 license applies)

Feel free to test this script out on your docs :-)
Feel free to contact me, rebecca.merrett@gmail.com, for any feedback. I'm interested to see the results or any issues to keep improving it. 

This will be properly integrated into the front end ([http://papyrus.jessechavez.info/#/documents](http://papyrus.jessechavez.info/#/documents)), and my team mate (Dany Chavez) and me will continue working on the project.
Note: No commits to the original GovHack repo will be made until judging period is over around end of August 2017.
